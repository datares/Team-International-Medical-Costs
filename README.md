Data
The data used to develop our Medium article came from: https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance

This dataset is a simulated dataset of the insurance costs charged on individuals by insurance companies based on a variety of factors such as age, region, number of children, and BMI. 


Data Processing

Because this was a collaborative project, analysis was done via both R and Python.


Analysis and Code

In our analysis, we will attemp to answer the following questions:

Is there a difference between the amount that males and females have to pay for insurance (and ethnicity) ?


How does an individualâ€™s BMI predict their medical cost from their insurance providers? 


Does the smoking status correlate to the insurance cost?


Are particular beneficiary geographical location related to the cost - e.g. are beneficiaries in a particular area associated with greater cost?


Does the number of children correlate with medical costs billed by insurance companies?
