Data

The data used to develop our Medium article came from: https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance


This dataset is a simulated dataset of the insurance costs charged on individuals by insurance companies based on a variety of factors such as age, region, number of children, and BMI. 


Data Processing

Because this was a collaborative project, analysis was done via both R and Python. The data was fairly tidy - for example, each variable was allocated to individual columns and each observation was given a particular row. Hence, there was not a lot of "data cleaning" needed on our behalf beyond extracting the variables that we need.


Analysis and Code

In our analysis, we will attemp to answer the following questions:

Is there a difference between the amount that males and females have to pay for insurance (and ethnicity) ?

     Our analysis shows that females have to pay more for insurance costs, and that those of non white ethnicities have to pay more for insurance costs. However, those of non white populations also tend to have a lower average income level.
     
How does an individualâ€™s BMI predict their medical cost from their insurance providers? 

     We deduced that a higher BMI is generally associated with a greater medical cost. In particular, as the BMI increases, the medical costs for insurance increases as well. 

Does the smoking status correlate to the insurance cost?

     We deduced that smoking status places individuals at risk of higher medical costs. This could be due partly to the increased blood pressure associated with smoking.
